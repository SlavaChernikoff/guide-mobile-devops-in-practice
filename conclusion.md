# Conclusion

The Mobile DevOps approach allows you to simplify and accelerate the process of creating a quality product. Quality testing and real usage monitoring will allow the team to respond quickly to problems and return our focus on improving the product and adding new functionality instead of constantly throwing problems and bugs between team members. 

In order for the entire team to communicate in a single language, it is necessary to use a single working documentation, on the basis of which the code will be written and functionality checked.

In our Guide, we covered the main aspects of Mobile DevOps, including working documentation, building an automatic CI/CD pipeline, testing on real devices, continuous monitoring and distribution of mobile applications.
