# 1. About DevOps culture

DevOps is primarily a culture in which the entire team of developers, QA engineers, and sysadmins work as a single team. Communication within the team is mandatory for building a healthy interaction between business, programmers, sysadmins and testers.

One of the key elements to any DevOps process is team education. In an ideal world, a team \(starting with a business\) must learn how to best meet the needs of the end user, creating value for the consumer. But in practice, we must learn how to quantify "value" and draw from this conclusion. For learning in any case, feedback from actual users is necessary. Such a connection requires a continuous monitoring of the IT systems' viability and a variety of logging systems.

DevOps should not only exist in the minds of developers, but it should also be implemented in practice using tools that fit the needs of the task. Part of the DevOps culture is also the desire to automate routine activities. This makes the process of developing IT systems less painful and more efficient.
